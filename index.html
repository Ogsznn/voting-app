      <p class="subtitle">
        Elections in Africa and Nigeria in particular have been plagued by issues of fraud, manipulation, and lack of transparency. There is no more transparency in the system. No one knows what happens to their votes after casting them. Voices are cast into the dustbin of history. The power is no longer with the people but with those in power. This is a raging problem in our society which has cost us years of bad governance and poor leadership. We are here to change the narrative. 
        <br>
        <br> 
        <strong>Lotena</strong> is a decentralized voting system built on the solana blockchain. Our sole aim is to provide a service whereby elections are truly free, fair and transparent. We are building a system that will ensure that every vote counts and is verifiable by anyone, anywhere, anytime. We are building a system that will ensure that the power is returned to the people. We are building a system that will ensure that the voices of the people are heard and respected.

      <h3>Why Blockchain Technology?</h3>
      <p>
        We at Lotena believe that the better question should be why not blockchain technology? We have been living in centralization for a long time and it hasn't profited us much in elections most especially in Africa and Nigeria. Blockchain technology provides a solution to the problems we face in elections today. It ensures that the voting process is transparent, secure, and tamper-proof. With blockchain technology, we can do away with the issues of fraud, manipulation, and lack of transparency that has been a nuisance in our elections. Finally, the power is returned to the people.
